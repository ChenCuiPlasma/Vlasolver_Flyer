<h2>2. <strong>Models and Equations for Vlasolver</strong></h2>
<p>The model used in this work is a Vlasov-Poisson system which is a kinetic description of the electrostatic collisionless plasma system(with or without the external B field). The Vlasov equation can be written as:

<h2>3. <strong>Simulation Methods and Computing Algorithm</strong></h2>
<p>The phase space(both physical and velocity space) will be discretized into computational mesh. The partial differential equations in the Vlasov-Poisson system will be solved directly on the mesh. While the Vlasov-Poisson system  is a non-linear system, the Vlasov equation itself is a first-order hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE).  Many numerical schemes have been developed to  solve hyperbolic PDEs.</p>
<p>The methods below are used to discretize the PDEs to numerically solve the Vlasov-Poisson system above.</p>
<ul>
<li>Operator Splitting.</li>
<li>Semi-Lagrangian time stepping.</li>
<li>Third Order Positive Flux Conservation[1] method on phase domain discretization. </li>
</ul>
<p>We use this term to describe the capability of handling the phase space dimensions: <strong>xDyV</strong> (x physical domain dimensions and y velocity domain dimensions). </p>
<p>The code will solve the Vlasov-Poisson system in the following process [2]:</p>

<h2>5. <strong>Code Structures</strong></h2>
<p>The code adopts objective-oriented structure. And the classes(modules) can be categorized into several groups. 
1. Utilities:
   * Control class
   * Mesh class
   * ParallelControl class(If parallelization enabled, all of the MPI functions used in this code are wrapped here.)
   * LocalMesh class(If parallelization enabled)
2. Containers:
   * ScalarField class
   * VectorField class
   * FunctionField class
3. Poisson Solver:
   * Poisson class
4. Vlasov Solver:
   * Vlasov class
   * InitialFun class(For initial condition and boundary condition implementations)
5. Diagnostic:
   * Diagnostics class</p>
<h2>6. <strong>Parallelization</strong></h2>
<p>Vlasolver is currently parallelized by doing domain decomposition  in physical domain. The physical domain is decomposed into local domains and assigned to the corresponding process. Informations are changed and stored in each local domain's guard cells. The velocity is not decomposed now and each process have a full set of velocity space. It is in the plan that in the future the shared-memory parallelization techniques or the heterogeneous computing techniques can be used to parallize the velocity space.</p>

<p>For the Vlasov equation solving module, the normal communication mode is used and each process send and receive information to/from their neighbors.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="./pics/parallel/parallel_strategy.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Schematic plot for the physical space communications</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Poisson solver, currently the code adopt the "Gather-and-Solve" mode. The global mesh information is used to construct the coefficient matrix for the Poisson solver at the initialization of the Poisson solver and the inverse matrix of this coefficient matrix is solved with the support of Eigen library and Intel MKL library. In each step, each process will calculate the local charge and these information will be gathered by the "solver" process, the "solver" process will then calculate the potential and E field based on this information and will broadcast the corresponding information for each processor. It is in the plan that in the future this code will support potential solver which solves the potential locally.</p>

<h2>7. <strong>Verification and Validation</strong></h2>
<p>We first carry out a two-dimensional simulation of the
two-stream instability as validation for the 2D2V Vlasolver. The initial set-up is set to be the same with the set-up in the work by Crouseilles [3].
For this case, only the  electrons are included in the simulation.
The electrons have two populations that counter-stream each other 
in the <img src="svgs/247357cb886ab8ec3fc4061854468659.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=15.3648pt height=14.102549999999994pt/> direction. The initial velocity distribution function is given as
<p align="center"><img src="svgs/eda8b6d99d19d5ec95b0dcdf4481ee22.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=402.7353pt height=32.950664999999994pt/></p>
The length of physical computational domain is set to be in the range [0, 4pi] in both x and y direction under the normalized unit. The length of velocity computational domain is set to be in the range [-9, 9] in both v_x and v_y direction under the normalized unit. 128 computational cells are used on each direction of the discretized phase space domain. Thus there are about 0.26 billion cells. Since the initial perturbation is in the x direction and velocity difference is in the v_x direction, the instability will basically grow along the x direction. Reduce order operations will be done to visualize the four-dimensional velocity distribution function datas by integrating along the y and v_y direction following Crouseilles's work[3]. The boundary conditions for the velocity space are set to be "cut-off" boundary condition and the physical space is set to have periodic boundary conditions.</p>
